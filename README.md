Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little about me:

    ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Code Craft, an online C# code editor for educators, built with React, C#, and SignalR for real-time collaboration. I'm also building Tosa, a tool that makes terms of service easier to understand.
    ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RabbitMQ, threat modeling, and enhancing my knowledge of distributed systems architecture.
    ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to backend development, logging tools, and developer productivity.
    ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my skills in automated testing, code reviews, and application security.
    ðŸ’¬ Ask me about C#, Docker, PostgreSQL, ASP.NET Core, React, and how to build secure and scalable APIs.
    ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to message me here on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn.
    âš¡ Fun fact: I have a background in pedagogy but transitioned into tech because I love solving complex problems with code! Oh, and Iâ€™m also a big fan of board games and roguelite games. ðŸŽ²ðŸŽ®

Let's build something awesome together!
